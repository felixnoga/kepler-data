## KEPLER DATA OBSERVATIONS - FILTERING CANDIDATES FOR HABITABLE PLANETS

Basic Node app that parses the Kepler observation data in csv format (csv-parse library used)
and filters the most suitable planets for having life.

Used Node JS streams and path and filesystem module to write the data to an external txt file.
